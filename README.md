## 📚 Course Overview

This course focuses on how to design, build, and evaluate autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, acting, and collaborating in real-world environments. By the end of the course, learners will be able to architect and implement robust agentic systems using modern frameworks, tools, and best practices.

### Learning Objectives

- ✅ Understand the theoretical foundations and architectural patterns of Agentic AI systems
- ✅ Design and implement single-agent and multi-agent systems with planning, memory, and tool use
- ✅ Build a production-ready Agentic AI application with evaluation, safety, and optimization considerations
